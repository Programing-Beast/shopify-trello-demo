# BePirate Illustrator Workflow Manual

At BePirate, we create fully hand-drawn personalized portraits inspired by the One Piece universe. Each order follows a structured workflow to ensure quality, clarity, and proper client approval before final delivery.

**Your role as an illustrator is simple:**
Draw the artwork, upload the correct file, and move the card to the correct column.
The system will handle client communication automatically.

---

## 1. New Order (ORDERS Column)
When a new order arrives from Shopify, a Trello card is automatically created in the ORDERS column.
You do not need to take action at this stage.

## 2. Assignment (IN PROCESS Column)
When the card is moved to IN PROCESS, the order is assigned to you.
You must begin working on the outline drawing.

## 3. Outline Completed (BOZZA PRONTA Column)
Once the outline is finished:
- Upload the outline file to the Trello card.
- Move the card to BOZZA PRONTA.

The system will automatically email the preview to the client and move the card to IN ATTESA OUTLINE.

## 4. Waiting for Client (IN ATTESA OUTLINE)
While waiting for the client, you do nothing.
- If the client approves, the card moves to DRAFT CONFIRMED.
- If revisions are requested, the card moves to REVISIONE OUTLINE.

## 5. Outline Revisions (REVISIONE OUTLINE)
1. Open the card and read the requested changes.
2. Make all modifications.
3. Upload the new version.
4. Move the card again to BOZZA PRONTA.

The system will resend it automatically.
Repeat until approved.

## 6. Outline Approved (DRAFT CONFIRMED)
The outline is approved.
Move the card to COLORING and begin the coloring process.

## 7. Coloring Completed (COLORED Column)
Once coloring is finished:
- Upload the colored version.
- Move the card to COLORED.

The system will automatically send the colored version to the client.
The card moves to IN ATTESA COLORE.

## 8. Coloring Revisions (REVISIONE COLORE)
If the client requests changes:
1. Open the card.
2. Make all requested modifications.
3. Upload the updated file.
4. Move the card back to COLORED.

The system resends automatically.

## 9. Final Approval (DA SPEDIRE)
When the client approves the final colored version, the card moves to DA SPEDIRE.
You do not need to take further action.

## 10. Completed (COMPLETATO)
After shipping or digital delivery, the card moves to COMPLETATO.
The project is finished.

## Important Rules
- **Always upload the file before moving the card.**
- Never send files manually via email.
- Never skip columns.
- Each column movement may trigger automatic communication.
- If you are unsure, ask before moving the card.
